<p>You want to help out? Awesome! There's three main ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href='http://bugs.launchpad.net/podbird'>File bug reports</a> - Is something not working right? Do you have an idea for a fancy new feature? File a bug report and we'll see what we can do.</li>
	<li><a href='http://translations.launchpad.net/podbird'>Translate podbird</a> - We want Podbird to be available in all languages, and that's only possible thanks to a lovely bunch of community translators who contribute translations for their native languages.</li>
	<li><a href='http://code.launchpad.net/podbird'>Write some code</a> - Podbird is Free and Open Source Software, so you can check out the code and help us to fix bugs or create new features.</li>
</ul>
